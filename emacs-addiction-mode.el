;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Keybinding for killing Emacs is an awful joke. It should not exist in the
;; first place. If I wanted to exit Emacs, I would call a doctor.
;;
;; `emacs-addiction-mode' comes into play. Quit killing Emacs. Raise your
;; addiction level and be happy about it.
;;
;; Call `emacs-addiction-mode' to turn it locally. Call
;; `global-emacs-addiction-mode' to turn it globally. Set your
;; `emacs-addiction-level' and conquer this Universe.
;;
;; Available levels:
;;
;; - neophyte - your addiction is new, so you are still unsure. You will be
;;   prompted if you really want to quit Emacs.
;;
;; - sane - On any attempt to kill Emacs you will be brought straight to the
;;   psychotherapist.
;;
;; - brian - you 'always look on the bright side of life'. So you don't need to
;;   kill Emacs.

argument disables it. From Lisp, argument omitted or nil enables
the mode, `toggle' toggles the state.

When Emacs addiction mode is enabled, you can't quit Emacs.

Literally. Depending on your `emacs-addiction-level'."
