Keybinding for killing Emacs is an awful joke. It should not exist in the first
place. If I wanted to exit Emacs, I would call a doctor.

=emacs-addiction-mode= comes into play. Quit killing Emacs. Raise your addiction
level and be happy about it.

Call =emacs-addiction-mode= to turn it locally. Call
=global-emacs-addiction-mode= to turn it globally. Set your
=emacs-addiction-level= and conquer this Universe.

Available levels:

- =neophyte= - your addiction is new, so you are still unsure. You will be
  prompted if you really want to quit Emacs.
- =sane= - you are a sane person. On any attempt to kill Emacs you will be
  brought straight to the psychotherapist.
- =brian= - you 'always look on the bright side of life'. So you don't need to
  kill Emacs anymore.
